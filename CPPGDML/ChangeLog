	* Writer/Writer/DocumentBuilder.h (Message): Fixed tricky memory
	leak reported by valgrind in the output stream initialization.
	Changed interface to open. write, close and reset

	one document can be saved to many file just by repeated calls to
	write with different output streams.

	env. variable

2004-06-01  Radovan CHYTRACEK  <radovan.chytracek@cern.ch>
	* check_platform.mk: Added makefile fragment checking for
	operating system type and trying to deduce the default SCRAM_ARCH
	value.
	* libgdml.mk: Now conditionally check if platform has been
	detected and if not so includes the check_platform.mk file above.
	* GNUMakefile: all affected makefiles have been brought up tp date
	due to changes in libgdml.mk.
	* cygwin_local_setup.sh: The file has been populated by a sample
	setup of my local machine where I have all the software needed to
	build and run GDML processor and g4gogdml example. If someone
	wants to play on Cygwin with GDML I highly recommend to have a
	look at this file.
	NOTE: This file will likely change in the future as Cygwin
	platform is not well established in configuration management
	system of LCG.

2004-05-31  Radovan CHYTRACEK  <radovan.chytracek@cern.ch>
	* GDML Schema files: moved into GDMLSchema directory and the old
	directory schema remained empty.

	configuration of the build process.
	* GNUMakefiles: all the makefiles affected by changes in the
	cern_afs_setup.sh have been brought up to date.
	* setup.sh: removed
	* G4VERSION: env. variable introduced and set to be default
	pointing to the last rh73_gcc32 GEANT4 release(6.1.ref01). The
	later releases will be or are already done by using the GCC 3.2.3
	compiler version.

	* geant4/Processor/GNUmakefile: 
	* Saxana/GNUmakefile (Repository): 
	* Processes/GNUmakefile: Fixed reference to libgdml.mk
	
	* Examples/g4gogdml/GNUmakefile: In addition fix for SCRAM_ARCH
	here too due to choosing the proper platform libraries for G4.

	* libgdml.mk: Fixed library and binary rules, SCRAM_ARCH fix to
	ensure only the suported one is set, renamed libgdml.gmk to libgdml.mk.A
