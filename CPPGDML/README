/\/\/\/\/\ GDML README /\/\/\/\/\

This is the README for the C++ version of the 
Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) package
with a binding to Geant4.

/\/\/\/\/\ Configuration and Build /\/\/\/\/\

Building GDML requires gcc/g++ and make (preferably gmake).

NOTE: Cygwin does not have the 'gmake' command so use plain 'make' instead.

To build CPPGDML for the first time:

	./GDMLSetup

To rebuild GDML:

	make

To reinstall the libraries in the specific place (optional):

	make install

The default installation directory is /usr/local, and this is
settable using the --prefix option.

To get a list of options:

	./configure --help

If you setup the following variables in the environment before
building, configure will (probably) run successfully without any 
options:

	G4INSTALL
	CLHEP_BASE_DIR
	XERCESCROOT

It would also be a good idea to source your Geant4 setup script 
before configuring, if you have one.  This is an example
in bash:

	source $G4INSTALL/.config/bin/$G4SYSTEM/env.sh 

This script sets the correct Geant4 environment for Granular 
or Global libs and for Visualization and User Interface settings,
which GDML's configuration system should pickup correctly
without any options. 

Example configurations can be found in SLACConfigure.sh and CERNConfigure.csh .

/\/\/\/\/\ Platforms /\/\/\/\/\

Currently supported operating systems are:

	Linux
	Darwin/OSX
	Cygwin

g++ and ia32 are currently the only supported compilers.
