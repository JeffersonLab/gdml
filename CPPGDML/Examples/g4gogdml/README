Example g4gogdml
----------------

A simple example demonstrating the usage of GDML file as the geometry
source for a Geant4 application. 
The only GDML-specific part of the code is in the
UserDetectorConstruction class (gogdmlDetectorConstruction) where the
GDML processor is instanciated and the geometry file is parsed. This
is a standard way of using GDML for any Geant4 application and can be
directly introduces into the user code.

The example contains a few example GDML files:

* geo.gdml - the simplest example, just one box in the world volume

* split.gdml - same as geo.gdml, but using ENTITY to split the file in
several pieces. The "materials" block is put in a separate file.

* modular_main.gdml - example demonstrating the usage of modular GDML
files. This file include modular_first.gdml, which includes
modular_second.gdml

* matricesandloops.gdml - example demonstrating usage of matrices and
loops 

* opticalsurfaces.gdml - example demonstrating the usage of optical
surfaces and material properties sheets


The example is built automatically while building all the GDML libraries
(by the make file in CPPGDML directory).

*******************************************************************
TO RUN THE EXAMPLE....
*******************************************************************

Set the environment variables like PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly.

../setup.csh has been generated automatically. source this script to 
set the above environment variables automatically.

Then use the command: 

g4gogdml

(using the default file test.gdml)

OR..

g4gogdml [filename]
