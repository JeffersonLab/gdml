Example g4N02gdml
----------------

A simple example demonstrating the usage of GDML writer to export the
Geant4 geometry in the form of the GDML file.

The geometry is instanciated using the standard
UserDetectorConstruction class (DetectorConstruction) and then
exported to GDML.

The only GDML-specific part of the code is in the main (g4N02gdml)
file where the G4GDMLWriter is instanciated (giving the name of the
output file and the location of the schema as arguments) and the
DumpGeometryInfo method (with the pointer to the top volume as
argument) is called.  

The procedure is a standard way of exporting the geometry in GDML and
can be used directly within the user code. The only necessary element
is that the Geant4 geometry is fully instanciated in memory and that
the pointer to the top volume is available.

The example is built automatically while building all the GDML
libraries (by the make file in CPPGDML directory).


*******************************************************************
TO RUN THE EXAMPLE....
*******************************************************************

Set the environment variables like PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH correctly.

../setup.csh has been generated automatically. source this script to 
set the above environment variables automatically.

Then use the command: 

g4N02gdml

(using the default file test.gdml)

OR..
