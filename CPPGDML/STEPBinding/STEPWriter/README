STEPWriter is a tool which allows to convert the ST-Viewer (CAD
visualisation tool) intermediate files (.geom and .tree) into GDML. It
uses tessellated solids to represent the geometry. 

The STEPWriter is not build by default. In order to build it one has
to add --enable-build-stepwrt=yes option to the configure command.
The STEPWriter is build as a separate library which one needs to link
against.

In order to use it, one has to include the appropriate header file

	#include "STEPWriter/STEPWriter.h"

instanciate the writer class

	STEPWriter* sw = new STEPWriter();
 
parse the ST-Viewer files

	sw->parse("myfile.geom","myfile.tree", false);

and finaly generate the GDML file
	
	sw->dump("myfile.gdml", "GDMLSchema/gdml.xsd");
