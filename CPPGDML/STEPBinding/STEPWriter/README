STEPWriter is a tool which allows to convert the ST-Viewer (CAD
visualisation tool) intermediate files (.geom and .tree) into GDML. It
uses tessellated solids to represent the geometry. 

In order to use it, one has to include the appropriate header file

	#include "STEPWriter/STEPWriter.h"

instanciate the writer class

	STEPWriter* sw = new STEPWriter();
 
parse the ST-Viewer files

	sw->parse("myfile.geom","myfile.tree", false);

and finaly generate the GDML file
	
	sw->dump("myfile.gdml", "GDMLSchema/gdml.xsd");
