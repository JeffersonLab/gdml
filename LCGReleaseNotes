14.07.2006 - GDML_2_6_0
-----------------------

The LCG release procedure for GDML has been simplified slightly. The
separate tags for CPPGDML and GDMLSchema will not be used anymore. The
common tag GDML_X_Y_Z will be the only one used. The Python GDML
processors will not be release anymore together with the rest of GDML
system. The GDML ROOT binding is now part of ROOT distribution and
therefore will not be furthered committed to GDML CVS.

This LCGReleaseNotes file will, from now on be the central 'release
information' holder for LCG releases. 

Main new elements in GDML_2_6_0 release:
	- added support for tessellated solids and tetrahedra
	- added (optional) STEPWriter enabling convertion form
	intermediate ST-Viewer files to GDML
	- several minor bugs fixed
	- small change in the G4Writer: the names of the generated
	GDML elements (solids, volumes, etc) are now appended with the
	object address converted to long int (instead of hex)
